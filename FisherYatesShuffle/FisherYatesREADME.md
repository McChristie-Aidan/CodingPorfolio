# FisherYatesShuffle
This is a coding example that shows the Fisher-Yates Shuffle, a simple way to shuffle an array.\
It works by randomly selecting numbers from a list of "unstruck" numbers\
Then you take whatever value is in the random position and move it to a seperate array and strike that number\
you repeat this process until there are no more numbers and then you have your array\
