# Array
An Array is a linear data structure that involves an indexed group of values with a set length.
Each value in an array has index from which it can be reference.
Arrays are particularly useful when you need to shuffle or sort a set number of values.

# Maps
A Map is a non linear data structure that requires specific keys to aquire the value.
Each value is at a location that only the "map" and anyone with the right key knows how to get too.
No two "locations" can have the same key but the can still have the same value.
In my example, I used a student id system to allow students to use their id's to access their own personal information.
