# Stack
Stacks are a last in first out data structure. 
This means whatever entered most recently is the first thing to come out. 
This makes me think of a "stack" of plates. 
The plate on top of the stack needs to come off before you move the other plates.

# Queue
Queues are a first in first out data structure.
this means the first thing put in is the first in line to get out.
This reminds me of waiting in line fora roller coast.
The person who gets in line first is the first person to get on the ride.
